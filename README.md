## ðŸ“Œ Project Phases

### ðŸŸ© Phase 1 â€“ Monolithic Architecture
- **Branch:** [`phase-1`](https://github.com/muntahaaa/Software-design-SE-606.git/phase-1-monolithic)
- Contains a single application in one codebase.
- Suitable for small-scale applications or initial MVP.

### ðŸŸ¦ Phase 2 â€“ Microservices Architecture
- **Branch:** [`phase-2`](https://github.com/muntahaaa/Software-design-SE-606.git)
- Contains multiple services (e.g., auth-service, user-service) communicating over APIs.
- Better for scalability, team autonomy, and distributed systems.
